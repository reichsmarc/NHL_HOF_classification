# Project \#3 - # NHL Hall of Fame Classification #
--------
The third Metis project involved using clustering/supervised learning techniques to solve a binary or multi-class classification problem. As a lifelong hockey player and fan, I chose to use my new skills to classify which players in the National Hockey League will make the Hall of Fame, using the [Open Source Sports Hockey Database.](http://www.opensourcesports.com/hockey/)

### Code cleanup in progress. ###
***To Do:***
------------
1. Further modularize code into functions.
2. Combine ROC plots and improve visualization of distinction between classifiers.

***Future:***
-------------
1. Scrape and re-run analysis with [complete, official NHL data made available as of today (9/27/17)!](https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-historical-stats-press-release/c-291394420)
